			<h3>Childhood</h3>
			<div class="para">
				<p>I grew up in the eastern Nigerian. This zone is widely known for their business accumen. Very skillful at buying and selling. Most graduate upon graduation drop their certificate and enter <em>street (market)</em>. I was not fully exempted from this imbreed character, although I keep pushing forward for higher degree as the present generation are, I am very enterprising. As a child in secondary school, I would rise up as early as 4am, rush to the market and make purchases of fruits and the later day business, then return before 7:30am to prepare for school. After school hour, I embark on the days business. This certainly did not affect my academic performance as I was on top of my class every term.<br><br>Childhood stories is incomplete without mentioning the times of hunting, playing football under the sun and rain until its so dark that you can't see the ball, <em>if there is moon, ofcourse the game continued</em>. I think childhood gradually faded away as we got into Senior secondary school, when typically I stopped fighting with my immediate elder brother.</p>

			<h3>University Days</h3>
			<div class="para">
				<p>I left home to a Polythechnic in Oko in Anambra State of Eastern Nigeria for a course in Electrical and Electronic Engineering popularily known as EEE by Nigerian students. There I was introduced to engineering practices as it relates to electricity and electronics devices. I also learnt things like house wiring, repair of electronics gadgets and lots more. After a year, I transfered to a University for a 5 year course in Mathematics. During this time, I developed kin interest in <strong>Computer Programing</strong>.<br><br>I paid for a 6 months training in JAVA. It was unfortunate that after a month into the training I stopped attending the classes. The tutor was not good at her work, just like a learner, she makes lots of mistakes and couldn't even debug them. I then started to learn JAVA on my own. Along the line, I got discouraged and stopped. Soon, I got to know of MATlab, it was great as it uses builtin functions to make the life of a numerical mathematician easy. From using built-in, I began to write  my own functions, then began to teach Futo students. My first tutorial classes I held was graced by grateful 18 attendees some of whom are in Europe now. From futo I began to get invitations to teach outside my school, then undergraduate projects, followed by masters project works from Engineering departments, then PHD projects. During my NYSC, I got a contract to teach final year Mechanical students who were taking a course on control systems. It was a bit challenging as it's not just about MATlab but also the <strong>control system</strong> which was totally strange to me. I also had to prepare the tutorial course outline.<br><br>I got to know of coursera.com and that was the begineering of programming with python, then machine learning and deep learning courses from Standford University and deeplearning AI helped me get going. Ever since, it has been from one adventure to another.</p>

			<h3>European Life</h3>
			<div class="para">
				<p>Just like an aeroplane wanting to take off, so was I immediately after my undergraduate degree. I began to travel from one Nigerian state to another trying to land a job or masters admission. Finally I got the masters admission in the number one university of the Nigerian State. I wasn't satisfied as the program is void of computing or computer programming, I got an opportunity and left to Europe.<br><br>On getting here, the love for software development got stronger. I travelled all the way to South Africa for the final interview with Microsoft after series of phone and Skype interviews. It didn't come out successful, but I got to know what these big firms need from their candidates. I tried to pursue those but was hindered as the first year of my program was really intensive. I tried forgetting software development as a career but the images of what I can build and create if fortified with the right tools and training keep disturbing me.<br><br>At a point I had thought of dropping out of school, but I know it's not a good option as my first year program, <strong>scientific computing</strong> can go a long way making me a better sopftware engineer when I finally get to it. As I write, the dream is big and still strong on me. <em>I will never rest till it comes through.</em></p>

				<p>My future is in a combination of software development, Data Science, AI, Machine learning, Deep learning and Big data. My interest is not in the theory but in applications where I can apply innovation and creativity merging these tools to build a life changing and money generating machine.</p>
