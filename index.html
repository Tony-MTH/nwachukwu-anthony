				<p>I grew up in the eastern Nigerian. This zone is widely known for their business accumen. Very skillful at buying and selling. Most graduate upon graduation drop their certificate and enter <em>street (market)</em>. I was not fully exempted from this imbreed character, although I keep pushing forward for higher degree as the present generation are, I am very enterprising. As a child in secondary school, I would rise up as early as 4am, rush to the market and make purchases of fruits and the later day business, then return before 7:30am to prepare for school. After school hour, I embark on the days business. This certainly did not affect my academic performance as I was on top of my class every term.</p>
